# Overview

# **zkSync Protocol Overview & Documentation**

ZkSync is a fully-fledged Layer-2 scaling solution, combining a set of system contracts on Ethereum mainnet, zkRollup smart contracts for scaling, and zkEVM for enabling Ethereum virtual machine-compatible smart contract execution.

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and code related to the Smart Contracts, Circuits, and VM sections of the zkSync Protocol. Below is a high-level summary of each section along with relevant documentation links. Please refer to these before and during the audit for a thorough understanding of the protocol.

## **üìÅ Sections**

### **3. VM Section**

The VM section is related to the zkSync Era Virtual Machine and contains elliptic curve precompiles and an extensive primer on zkSync EVM.

- **[ZkSync Era Virtual Machine Primer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/VM%20Section/ZkSync%20Era%20Virtual%20Machine%20primer.md)**
    - This primer is designed to provide auditors with a foundational understanding of the zkSync Era Virtual Machine. It offers insights into the operational mechanics and integral components of zkSync EVM, serving as an essential guide for those seeking to explore the zkSync EVM environment.
- **[zkSync Era: The Equivalence Compiler Documentation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/VM%20Section/compiler-equivalence-docs/zkSync%20Era%20-%20The%20Equivalence%20Compiler%20Documentation.md)**
    - zkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. As it's EVM-compatible (with Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without needing to refactor or re-audit any code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually enable developers to write smart contracts in popular languages such as C++ and Rust.
- **[spec.pdf](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/VM%20Section/spec.pdf)**
    - This document is a highly technical and detailed specification, providing an in-depth exploration of the zkSync protocol and its underlying architecture. It‚Äôs a comprehensive resource for those who desire a deeper and more formal understanding of the protocol's design and functionalities. While it‚Äôs not a required read for understanding the basic structure and operations of the protocol, it is an invaluable resource for those wishing to delve into the finer details and theoretical underpinnings of zkSync.

## **üö® Audit & Code Freeze**

Be advised that a code freeze will be in effect for the duration of the audit to ensure a level playing field. All participants are required to review and adhere to the final versions of contracts and documentation added in this repository at least 48 business hours prior to the audit start time.

## **üöÄ Getting Started for Auditors**

- Ensure to go through each section and related documents thoroughly.
- Keep in mind the overall working of the zkSync protocol while reviewing individual components.
- Review the code and documentation with a focus on security, correctness, and optimization, particularly concerning gas consumption.

## **üì¢ Communication**

For any clarifications, doubts, or discussion, please contact Code4rena staff, and we will address your concerns promptly.
